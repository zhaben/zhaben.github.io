Data science can help us understand what a business needs for improvement. It is multidisciplinary, encompassing processes from the fields of business, computer science, and mathematics. It is not data analytics. There is a popular saying that a data scientist knows more about statistics than any software engineer and more software engineering than any statistician. 

More technically, data scientists know how to perform regression analysis (predict a continuous value when there are several variables), classification analysis (predict which category something will fall into), anomaly detection (identify unusual outcomes), and generate recommender systems (predict user preferences toward a product or service).

We take advantage of data science all the time. When your credit card company contacts you about potential fraud activity on your account---that’s anomaly detection, and when advertisements seem to pop up at the right time in the right place---that’s regression analysis.

Actually, the most successful companies put data science at the center of their business model. Netflix and Google are prime examples. When Netflix provides a list of shows you would like---that’s a recommender system. When Google filters out your spam and social networking emails---that’s classification analysis. Furthermore, life wouldn’t be as smooth without autocomplete, autocorrect, spell-check, and grammar-check.

There is an industry standard for professional tools that help data scientists to extract knowledge and insights from data. The most fundamental include: web-based notebooks (Jupyter Notebook), a library for exploring raw and structured data (Pandas), an IDE or text editor for software development (Atom), version control software for tracking changes in code (Git/Github), a framework for processing large amounts of data (Spark), a language to query databases (SQL), and a library to create meaningful visualizations of the data that are beautiful and interactive (Bokeh).

Anaconda, an integrated data science platform, provides some of these technologies and more, speeding up the process for developing and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models. AI refers to the general capability of computers do things that usually require humans intelligence (i.e. Siri and Alexa), and ML is a branch of AI where computers learn from experience (i.e. Facebook suggesting that you tag yourself in a photo).

Anaconda is end-to-end, meaning that it supports everything from the beginning stages of collecting data from files and databases, managing virtual environments (Conda) and project sharing/collaboration, to the ending stages of deployment which is the process of making a project ready for use. 

Along with computer science and mathematics, business acumen is essential to data science because it provides direction. Analysis and algorithms are not really useful without direction. A data scientist needs to know *why* they are looking, in order to know *what* to look for, and to communicate *how* their findings can help.

<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>


<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
