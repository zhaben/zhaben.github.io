For as long as I can remember, I have always been prone to picking things apart and getting to the bottom of them. I was the child who asked What are the facts? and I was relentless enough to find solutions to whatever problem sparked my curiosity—wherever I found them.


The acquisition of knowledge would become a lifelong pursuit. I liked having a diversity of activities, hobbies, and learning opportunities at my disposal. In general, I would become bored if I wasn’t constantly moving or trying out something new––whatever that something was, as long as it was a learning experience. 


I have always been interested in understanding people, too. I was never a stranger to the What kind of empath are you? part of the internet, and the How to manage your time more effectively? part of WikiHow as a result. I figured both of those out, thankfully.


Not only did I become consumed with traveling through pages and people, but I also spent some time lost in France, often to the dismay of my quintessentially Jamaican mother, “Why can’t you stay in one place?” Mother dearest, that question can only be answered with quiche.


Among the many guiding questions of my life, some of the most influential have been: How do I discover what I don’t know? and How do I leverage my resources in order to do that?


I value versatility, diversity, and flexibility.


I was the teen that smiled at whatever was “liberal arts”, because to me that meant the freedom to explore. It meant unlocking the versatility of perspective. My approach to college was indeed, multidisciplinary. I was always on the path toward social science. I had a semester of I’m a psychology major, what about you?, until I became more interested in the economy and how we depend on social institutions and culture to guide our decisions and behaviors.

While choosing to pursue a degree program in both Economics and Sociology, as opposed to simply taking classes in one to supplement my education in the other, was a huge investment of time, I knew that how I was learning to think was essential to what I would later decide to do as a professional.


I like food for thought, and I’ve become experienced in theoretical and qualitative discovery, but I also like to take things a step further––so I started learning Python. And no, not for the sake of learning Python this time, but because of how I could leverage Python to analyze and solve problems more efficiently.


Data science tools would give me the aptitude to produce insights that are actionable. 


Social facts are facts, that are backed by statistical analysis, such as demography, and the scientific method. Interviews are great too––they give me an excuse to listen to people talk about their lives. However, I had to ponder the question: What is the best way for me to implement change?


How can I gain a different perspective to figure out what to do about social and business problems? Working through analyses that are more quantifiable and visual can unlock perspective, truth, and help with the leveraging of resources for a more pareto improved world– that is, if we come to agree on a more sustainable and energy-efficient one.


A career in Data Science, as we now call it, offers me horizontal mobility, unlimited learning opportunities, and the potential to incite change. I couldn’t ask for a more suitable next step.

<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
